# Predicting Movie Ratings with Guassian Matrix Factorization
I implemented a gaussian matrix factorization model and used MAP estimation on the MovieLens dataset to predict the rating a user would give to an unseen movie. All algorithms were written from scratch.

Read more about the data, model, data preparation, and practical learning during MAP estimation in the PDF in the repo.

The code is in the jupyter notebook.

# Recognition 
Code was shared as a representative solution in a PhD Level Statistics and Machine Learning Course with over 100 students.
