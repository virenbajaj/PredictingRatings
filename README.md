# Predicting Movie Ratings with Guassian Matrix Factorization
I implemented a gaussian matrix factorization model and used MAP estimation on the movie lens dataset to predict the rating a user would give to an unseen movie.

Read more about the data, model, data preparation, and practical learining during MAP estimation in the PDF in the repo.
The code is in the jupyter notebook.
